    "Creating an API endpoint in AWS involves several steps, typically using AWS services such as API Gateway and AWS Lambda. Here is a high-level overview of the process:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Create an AWS Lambda Function:\n",
    "        Go to the AWS Management Console.\n",
    "        Navigate to AWS Lambda.\n",
    "        Click \"Create function.\"\n",
    "        Choose \"Author from scratch.\"\n",
    "        Give your function a name, select the runtime (e.g., Python 3.8), and create a role with basic Lambda permissions.\n",
    "        Write your function code in the editor or upload it as a .zip file.\n",
    "        Click \"Create function.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    Create an API Gateway:\n",
    "        Go to the AWS Management Console.\n",
    "        Navigate to API Gateway.\n",
    "        Click \"Create API.\"\n",
    "        Choose \"REST API\" or \"HTTP API\" based on your needs (REST API is more feature-rich but HTTP API is simpler and has lower latency).\n",
    "        Select \"Build.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    Configure API Gateway:\n",
    "        Create a new resource or use the root resource.\n",
    "        Click \"Actions\" and select \"Create Resource.\"\n",
    "        Enter a name for the resource and click \"Create Resource.\"\n",
    "        With the new resource selected, click \"Actions\" and select \"Create Method.\"\n",
    "        Choose the HTTP method you want to support (e.g., GET, POST) and click the checkmark.\n",
    "        In the \"Integration Type\" section, select \"Lambda Function.\"\n",
    "        Select \"Use Lambda Proxy integration\" if you want to use the Lambda proxy feature.\n",
    "        Enter the name of your Lambda function and click \"Save.\"\n",
    "        Click \"OK\" to give API Gateway permission to invoke your Lambda function.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Deploy the API:\n",
    "        In API Gateway, click on \"Actions\" and select \"Deploy API.\"\n",
    "        Create a new stage (e.g., \"dev\") and click \"Deploy.\"\n",
    "        Note the Invoke URL provided after deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Test the API:\n",
    "        Use tools like Postman or cURL to send requests to the endpoint using the Invoke URL.\n",
    "        Verify that your Lambda function is being executed and returning the expected responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Lambda Function Code (Python)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example of a Python Lambda function that handles HTTP GET requests:\n",

    "def lambda_handler(event, context):\n",

    "        'body': json.dumps('Hello from Lambda!')\n",
